Basics of programming:

# Programming :

--> Attempting to get a computer to comlete a specific task without making mistakes.

--> Computers only understand machine code that is 0's and 1's.

--> Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English Instructions to Binary.

# Programming Languages :

--> Programming Languages serve as a middle-man of sorts

--> Translate instruction into Machine code

# Syntax

--> Rules you must follow to run program correctly
eg:

- how you type out certain functions
- How to write

# Variables

--> Something that can store information.
--> It can be referenced and manipulated.

- Types of Variables:

primitive type variables
--> Integers --> 4
--> Booleans --> False
--> floats --> 4.56
--> double --> 2.50
--> Strings --> "Hi"
--> Char --> 'c'

# Naming convention of variables

--> They must be one continous string.
--> must not start with numeric.
--> special characters not allowed.
--> keywords cannot be used as variable names.

# Conditional Statements

--> Depending on certain conditions , we want our code to do different things.

--> if the condition is "true" do one thing or else do another thing.

--> Each condition is evaluated as a boolean which is "true" or "false".

# Arrays

--> An array is a list of something.

--> The single most important thing to note about arrays is how we reference each element inside of them.

--> In programming we use indexes starts with 0

# Loops

--> A loops is a statement that is used to run certain instructions repeatedly

--> very useful for repeated sections of code

--> In loops we have three things:

- starting value
- A condition
- increment/decrement

# Errors

--> Code doesn't always work as expected
--> These are known as errors
--> Three different types:

- Syntax Errors:
  --> Parts in your program where you fail to meet the programming rules,resulting in an error.
- Rutime Errors:
  --> Don't appear until you actually "run" the code
- Logic Errors:
  --> undesired output

# Commenting

--> Allows us to mark-up the code without the computer reading it as actual code.
--> Essentially a documentation tool for programmers

# Functions

--> A segment of code that can be easily run by "calling" the function name
--> Depending on the type of function,may do something in return

# Arguments

--> Variables we pass into a function in order to be manipulated and then either

- returned back to us
- printed to the console
- used in another operation
